React/Redux boilerplate
=======================
Used in web-pal for creating project's architecture.

This architecure based on [redux documentation](http://redux.js.org/), so for deeply understanding just read it.


## To keep clean project's architecture, use these principles:
* [Data normalizing](http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/reducers/NormalizingStateShape.html) is the most important think that you have to use.
* [Simple reducer](http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/reducers/UpdatingNormalizedData.html) I suggest to use "Slice Reducer Composition".
* [Memorized selectors](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect)
